# GOOGLE DOCS CLONE

Google Docs is a popular cloud-based document editing and collaboration tool developed by Google. It allows users to create, edit, and store documents online, and collaborate with others in real-time.

As a developer, I have created a clone of Google Docs using Flutter, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB. The clone has the following features:

## Features
•	Sign in with Google: Users can sign in to the application using their Google account for authentication and authorization.

•	Create New Documents: Users can create new documents within the application, similar to Google Docs.

•	Add Text to Documents: Users can add and edit text content within the documents, just like in Google Docs.

•	Save Documents: Users can save their changes to the documents, and the changes will be persisted in the database.

•	Share Link to Documents: Users can share the link to the documents with others, allowing for easy collaboration.

•	Auto Save: The application has an auto-save feature that automatically saves changes to the documents at regular intervals to ensure data is not lost.

•	Collaborative Editing: Multiple users can collaborate in real-time on the same document, just like in Google Docs.

## Technologies Used
•	Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

•	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side JavaScript execution.

•	Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js used for building server-side applications.

•	Socket.io: A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

•	MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving documents in a flexible, JSON-like format.

This Google Docs clone is designed to provide similar functionality to Google Docs, with the added benefit of being built using Flutter for cross-platform support and using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB for the backend implementation. Users can sign in, create documents, collaborate in real-time, and save their changes within the application.
